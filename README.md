### This is an exercise in making a simple cake store web page.

Written in Next.JS

### Run the dev server: npm run dev

Content is editable with the included Outstatic content manager, but then you need to set it up on your own github.
Admin panel: localhost:3000/outstatic 

As from the outstatic site:
"We provide you with a user interface to create and edit website content. There is no database or server to set up: all the data is added to your GitHub repository.
To see the changes on your website, you'll need to wait until Vercel finishes deploying it. In the case that you are developing your site locally, you'll need to pull the changes to see them on your dev environment."
